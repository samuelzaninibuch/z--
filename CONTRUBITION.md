# This page is for contrutors, especially these starting
this page is for clarifying some parts that most misunderstand

# 1. debug mode

if you looked trouth z--.py, you will find debug_mode, this part is not for everyday debugger, but use to help where the part is leaked/broken, especially on parser or intepreter
# 2. feactures
as you may know, essential feactures are missing, though it will change over time, the final time will be transporting to c++, not python, then it will gain alot of perfomace
if you want add a feacture, you need clarify what it does
